# 📢 Week 6 – Python Libraries for Competitive Programming 🧰⚡

Welcome to **Week 6** of our Python learning journey! This week, we shift gears from algorithms to tools—exploring the most powerful **Python libraries** that can boost your coding speed, clarity, and efficiency in competitive programming. 🚀

---

## 🔍 What You'll Learn

### ✅ 1. Why Use Libraries?
Python libraries are pre-written collections of code that:
- ⏱ Save time
- 🧹 Make your code cleaner and shorter
- 🧠 Solve complex problems more efficiently

Whether you're into **competitive programming**, **data analysis**, or **machine learning**, the right libraries make a big difference.

---

### ✅ 2. How to Use Python Libraries
- Learn to `import` libraries correctly
- Explore commonly used modules
- Get comfortable navigating official documentation
- Practice using and not using libraries to understand their value

## 🧱 3. Core Python Libraries to Master

| Library       | Purpose                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `math`        | Fast mathematical functions (e.g., `gcd`, `sqrt`)        |
| `collections` | Specialized data structures (`Counter`, `deque`, etc.)   |
| `heapq`       | Priority queues (min-heaps)                              |
| `bisect`      | Binary search on sorted lists                            |
| `itertools`   | Combinatorics, permutations, efficient iteration         |
| `functools`   | Memoization (`lru_cache`), higher-order functions        |
| `sys`         | Fast input/output operations                             |
| `random`      | Random number generation for testing                     |
| `string`      | Useful constants like ASCII letters and digits           |

## 💡 Pro Tip

> Memorizing every function is **not the goal**.  
> Learning **how to find, use, and read documentation** is the real skill that will help in interviews, contests, and real-world projects.
