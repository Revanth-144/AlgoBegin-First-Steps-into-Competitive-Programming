## üêç Python Competitive Programming Roadmap (8 Weeks)

### üìÑ Project Description

This 8-week structured roadmap is designed to build a solid foundation in **Python for competitive programming**, progressively covering essential topics and practical techniques.

Starting with Python setup, input/output methods, and built-in data structures, the roadmap advances into:

- **Advanced list operations**
- **Collections and custom data structures**
- **Key algorithms** like searching, sorting, and greedy strategies
- **Graph algorithms** using Python‚Äôs libraries and idioms
- **Dynamic programming** with memoization, tabulation, and advanced patterns

It also leverages libraries such as `NumPy`, `itertools`, and `functools` for writing efficient code.

**Contest strategies**, including time management, reusable code templates, and mock contests, are integrated to simulate real-time competition environments. The journey culminates in a **final hands-on project** to consolidate all the skills acquired.
