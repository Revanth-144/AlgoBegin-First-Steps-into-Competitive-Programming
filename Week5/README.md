# 📢 Week 5 Announcement – Dynamic Programming in Python 🧠🚀

We’re diving into one of the most essential and game-changing topics in computer science — **Dynamic Programming (DP)**!

Hey everyone!  
Welcome to **Week 5** of our Python learning journey! This week is all about cracking the logic behind **Dynamic Programming** — a powerful technique to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and avoiding repeated work.

## 🔍 What to Study

- ✅ What is Dynamic Programming?
- ✅ Difference between Recursion, Memoization, and Tabulation
- ✅ Common Patterns in DP Problems
- ✅ Classic Problems:
  - Fibonacci Sequence  
  - 0/1 Knapsack  
  - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)  
  - Coin Change  
  - Subset Sum  
- ✅ Time and Space Optimization Techniques

---

## 🧠 How to Study

- Start with brute-force recursion to understand the problem.
- Visualize recursion trees to identify repeated work.
- Implement top-down (memoization) → then convert to bottom-up (tabulation).
- Write transitions clearly: “What does `dp[i]` or `dp[i][j]` mean?”
- Practice debugging your table — step through the logic line by line.

## 💡 Pro Tip

Spend time **understanding state and transitions** — DP isn’t about memorizing formulas, it’s about thinking smart.  
Solve problems slowly and revisit them after a break — the patterns will start to click!
