# 📢 Week 7 Announcement – Python Contest Strategies 🧠🏁

Hey everyone!  
Welcome to **Week 7** of our Python learning journey! This week, we go beyond just solving problems—we’ll focus on **how to approach coding contests like a pro**. Whether it’s **Codeforces**, **LeetCode**, or **Hackerrank**, these strategies can boost your rank and reduce your stress. 🏆🐍

## 🔍 What You'll Learn:

### ✅ 1. Contest Mindset: Solve Smart, Not Just Fast
- Learn how to **prioritize problems** based on difficulty.  
- Understand **when to move on, guess, or debug**.  
- Develop a structured plan to **maximize your score** in limited time.

### ✅ 2. Pre-Contest Preparation
- Set up your **template** with fast I/O, imports, and utility functions.  
- Practice topics that frequently appear (e.g. **binary search**, **prefix sums**, **graphs**).  
- Know your tools: `math`, `bisect`, `collections`, `heapq`, `itertools` — from last week!

### ✅ 3. During the Contest
- **Read all problems** first.  
- Start with the **easiest problem** to build confidence.  
- **Manage your time** wisely.  
- Stay calm — **accuracy > speed** in the early game.

### ✅ 4. Post-Contest Practice
- Always **upsolve** problems you couldn’t solve during the contest.  
- **Learn from editorials** and community solutions.  
- **Record your mistakes** and reflections for future review.

## 🎯 Bonus Tips:
- ⚡ Learn common patterns: `two pointers`, `sliding window`, `greedy`, `DFS/BFS`.  
- ⚡ Avoid **"brute-force tunnel vision"** — always ask: *Can I optimize this?*  
- ⚡ **Practice under timed conditions** to build stamina and sharpen decisions.

## 💡 Pro Tip

Contests aren't just about being fast — they’re about being **strategic, composed, and consistent**.  
Treat each one as a **learning opportunity**, not just a scoreboard.

Let’s make **Week 7** a turning point where we move from coders to **contest-ready problem solvers**! 🧠🏁🐍  
**Happy coding, and see you at the leaderboard! 🚀**
