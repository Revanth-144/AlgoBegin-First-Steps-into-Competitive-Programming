# 📢 Week 4 Announcement – Graph Algorithms in Python 🌐📊

Hey everyone!  
**Week 4** is here and it’s time to enter the world of **Graphs** — one of the most exciting and powerful topics in programming! ⚡

---

## 👋 Welcome to Week 4!
Graphs help us model **networks, relationships, routes**, and more — and are essential for **interviews**, **real-world applications**, and **competitive programming**.

---

## 🔍 What to Study:

✅ Graph Basics – Nodes, Edges, Adjacency List/Matrix  
✅ Traversal – DFS & BFS  
✅ Cycle Detection (Directed & Undirected)  
✅ Topological Sorting (Kahn’s & DFS)  
✅ Shortest Paths – Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, BFS  
✅ Minimum Spanning Trees – Kruskal, Prim  
✅ Union-Find (Disjoint Sets)  
✅ **Bonus**: Strongly Connected Components (SCC)

---

## 🧠 How to Study:

🔹 Visualize graphs using diagrams first  
🔹 Dry-run DFS/BFS manually to understand the flow  
🔹 Implement from scratch – **no copy-paste!**  
🔹 Solve problems on each concept before moving on  
🔹 Use helper tools like `visited[]`, `queue`, `parent[]`, etc.

## ⚡ Tip of the Week:

Master the logic of **DFS**, **BFS**, and **Dijkstra** — they form the base of most graph problems.  
Once you're comfortable, explore **Union-Find** and **Topological Sort**.
