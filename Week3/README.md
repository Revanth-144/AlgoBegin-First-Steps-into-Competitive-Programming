# 📢 Week 3 Announcement – Python Algorithms Implementation 🧠⚡

Apologies for the slight delay, but we're back and ready to roll!

Hey everyone!  
Welcome to **Week 3** of our Python journey — this week is all about **Algorithms Implementation**.  

Algorithms are the core of problem-solving in programming. Whether it's sorting a list, searching for an element, or optimizing a process, mastering algorithms helps you write **faster and smarter code**.

## 🔍 What to Study:

- **Sorting Algorithms** (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)  
- **Searching Algorithms** (Linear, Binary)  
- **Recursion Fundamentals**  
- **Basics of Greedy and Backtracking**  
- **Time and Space Complexity (Big-O Notation)**

---

## 🧠 How to Study:

- Understand the logic first – **don’t jump into code right away**
- Dry run algorithms with pen and paper to grasp their flow
- Write code from scratch to **solidify your understanding**
- Solve problems that specifically target each algorithm
- Compare and analyze performance of different approaches

---

## 💻 Practice Here:

Here are some awesome platforms to sharpen your algorithm skills:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) – Great for structured problem sets and interview prep  
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-algorithms) – Interactive algorithm tutorials  
- [GeeksforGeeks Practice](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?page=1&sortBy=submissions) – Topic-wise problems with solutions  
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset) – For competitive programming practice

---

## 💡 Tip:

Practice a few problems per topic and **revisit tougher ones** after mastering the basics.  
Focus on **clear logic first** — optimization comes next.
